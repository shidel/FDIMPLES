Welcome to the new QuickCrt version 9.x

Released Under GPL v2.0 License.

QuickCrt 9 is a complete rewrite of the previous versions. This
version is 100% assembly code and is designed to be directly
built into asm projects. It also includes, Turbo Pascal unit
wrappers for creating programs in TP5.5 & TP7.0.

It's goal is to simplify creating text mode console programs.
At present, it only supports 16-bit DOS. However, eventually,
I would like to support 32/64-bit Mac, Windows and Linux
consoles as well.

Requirements:
	NASM 2.11.08 for DOS
	286+ CPU (TargetCPU, 8086 compitibility untested)
	FreeDOS, DosBox or other DOS based operating system.
	TurboPascal 5.5 (Verion 7.0 recommended) for Pascal
